# Robotic-Crane :oncoming_automobile:
It is an <i>IOT based project</i> in which I used Arduino, Bluetooth Sensor(HC05) along with accessories and other components. The project basically designed to do pick and drop work wirelessly controlled through Mobile App.<br>
In this I used Bluetooth RC Car Controller Android App which is available on <b>Google Play Store.</b><br>
<b>Link to the App:smile: :-</b> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=braulio.calle.bluetoothRCcontroller&hl=en_IN&gl=US
<br>Note:- You need to adjust the delays according to the motion of your motors in arduino code.
